# Kalaha (Mancala) - Python Implementation

A playable terminal version of the ancient board game **Kalaha** (also known as Mancala), featuring a strong AI opponent.

## 🎮 Features
- **Game Modes**:
  - Human vs Human
  - Human vs Bot
  - Bot vs Human
- **Advanced AI**:
  - **Minimax Algorithm** with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
  - **Transposition Table** powered by **Zobrist Hashing** for high performance.
  - **Move Ordering** to optimize search efficiency.
  - **Heuristics** evaluating material, side control, mobility, and capture potential.
- **Customizable**: Configurable search depth (default: 6).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone the repository or navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python kalaha/main.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a game mode and play.

## 📜 Rules
- **Board**: Two rows of 6 pits each, plus a store (Kalaha) for each player.
- **Seeds**: Starts with 6 seeds per pit.
- **Objective**: Capture more seeds in your store than your opponent.
- **Movement**:
  - Choose a pit to sow its seeds counter-clockwise.
  - If the last seed lands in your store, you get an **Extra Turn**.
  - If the last seed lands in an empty pit on your side, you **Capture** that seed and all seeds in the opposite pit.
- **Game Over**: When one player's pits are all empty. Remaining seeds on the board go to the respective owners.
